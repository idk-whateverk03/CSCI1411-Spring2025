.SYNOPSIS
  Assignment #1 (KALI) - PowerShell Basics
.DESCRIPTION
  The goal of this assignment is to get you familiar with PowerShell basic concepts. 
  You will demonstrate your knowledge in Variables, Arrays, and CMDLETs.
  There are a total of 12 problems in this assignment. This version of Assignment 1 is slightly modified to work inside Kali virtual environments.

#----------------------------------------------------------[Variables]-------------------------------------------------------
### You can store all types of values in PowerShell variables. 
### A variable is a unit of memory in which values are stored. 
### 1. Create a two int variables $i and $x and assign the value to 122 and 633 respectively.
## YOUR CODE HERE

$i = 122
$x = 633

### 2. Now, add $i and $x together and store the value in another variable $y. 
### Then output(print) the value of $y to the console.
## YOUR CODE HERE

$y = $i + $x
$y


### 3. Divide $y by $i and round the answer to the two closest decimal places and 
### store the value in variable $z. Then print value of $z to the console. 
### HINT: Do some research on how to round values in PowerShell online. Lots of examples are available ;)
## YOUR CODE HERE

$z = $y/$i  
$z = [math]::Round($z)
$z


### 4. In PowerShell strings and number variables can added together. 
### Create a variable $str and set it to "The value of z is: " and 
### add $str and $z together. Then output $str to the console.
## YOUR CODE HERE

$str = "The value of z is : "
$str = $str + $z
$str


#----------------------------------------------------------[Arrays]-------------------------------------------------------
### Arrays are powerfull datatype that can store a collection of items.
### 1. Create an array variable named $arr and set it to 
### the following collection of integers (10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100)
## YOUR CODE HERE

$arr = @(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)


### 2. Create a new variable called $itemSum and store the sum of the 2nd and last item in $arr. 
### Print the resule to the console. (10,->20<-,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,->100<-)
## YOUR CODE HERE

$itemSum = $arr[1] + $arr[9]
$itemSum

#----------------------------------------------------------[CMDLET]-------------------------------------------------------
### This section examines the use of CMDLETs to find information. 
### It begins with a large set of data returned back to us. Later we will continue
### to filter out unneccessary data until the desired set of data is returned.

## 1. Create a variable called $files1 and assign it the output  only files
## inside of subfolders in the "Datasets" folder included using the cmdlet "Get-ChildItem"
## HINT: You will need to use two additional parameters to recusively retrieve only files in all sub-directories
## HINT: 37 items will be returned. Use count attribute to verify size (Example: $files1.count)
## YOUR CODE HERE

$files1 = Get-ChildItem -Path "Datasets" -Recurse 
$files1.count


### 2. Create a variable called $files2 and assign it the output all ".csv" files 
### in "Datasets" using the cmdlet: Get-ChildItem
## HINT:  34 files returned
## YOUR CODE HERE

$files2 = Get-ChildItem -Path "Datasets" -Recurse -Filter "*.csv"
$files2.count

### 3. Create a variable called $files3 and assign it the output all ".csv" files 
### larger than 50 KB (Length > 50KB) in "Datasets" using the cmdlet: Get-ChildItem
## HINT: 7 files returned. 
## YOUR CODE HERE

$files3 = Get-ChildItem -Path "Datasets" -Recurse -Filter "*.csv" | Where-Object {$_.Length -gt 50KB} 
$files3.count

### 4.  Create a variable called $files4 and assign it the output all ".csv" files 
### that start with the letter "a" and larger than 50 KB (Length > 50KB) in 
### "Datasets" using the cmdlet: Get-ChildItem
## HINT: 2 files returned
## YOUR CODE HERE

$files4 = Get-ChildItem -Path "Datasets" -Recurse -Filter "a*.csv" | Where-Object {$_.Length -gt 50KB}
$files4.count

### 5. Now that the two files we were looking for are found and stored in $files4, 
## let's export them out to CSV file named findings.csv
## HINT: 1 CSV file should output to the current directory. 
## YOUR CODE HERE

$files4[0] | Export-Csv -Path "findings.csv" 
$files4[0]

### 6. Over 1000 CMDLETS are available in PowerShell, research and find 
### a CMDLET to test displays running processes on a system.
### For this exercise, execute the cmdlet you found
### and store in a variable name $processes. 
### Lastly, print $processes to the console. Did it succeed?
## YOUR CODE HERE 

$processes = Get-Process -Id 8267
$processes
